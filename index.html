    <h1>Laminar Flow</h1>
    <p><strong>Laminar flow</strong> is when fluid moves along a path that is <strong>smooth</strong> and <strong>parallel</strong> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow" title="laminar flow" target="_blank"> this</a>.
       There is little to no mixing between adjacent layers unlike turbulent flow.</p>
